The goal is to create a function that takes a number of cents and returns a hash containing the least number of coins needed to generate the value.
Note: The final working file is app_cash_changer
Note: removal of cat(s) from keyboard may occur as often as needed, followed immediately by proof-reading.

This repo contains the cash_changer app, cash_changer.rb, and cash_changer_test, which I used to create the app. It also contains an earlier version, the coin_changer and test, which are no longer needed.
You run this in Sinatra. A text box pops up, and you type in the number of cents (not dollars)you have, and it will tell you which denomination of coin you need and how many of each.
